My website has been made using HTML/CSS/JS, so there is no need for any extra steps to run it. The only external source use was a CSS framework called Bootstrap, but all Bootstrap elements used were heavely modified by me. No other external code was used. 

All images were sourced from different game platforms such as Steam, Epic, Uplay, PSN, GOG. Most of my icons/trailers/images for the games are also sources the files straight from CDNs of Steam and Epic as downloading them into my images folder would just bloat the file. I also used a font called "Font Awsome" for many of my icons and svgs.

Open index.html in your browser and tyour are good to go. Please use Chrome as there are known bugs with FireFox localStorage which do impact my website and will cause the purchase of games to fail.

I have also made my repo public on GitHub and used GitHub Pages to host my site. You can access my repo from the link below:
